📘 1. Project Overview — Complete Summary
Project Name:

🕒 Modular OLED Clock (DS3231 + SSD1306 + NeoPixel)
Platform: Arduino Nano (ATmega328P) using PlatformIO

📌 Core Goals

You are building a clean, modern, extensible digital clock system with:

A 128×64 SSD1306 OLED for UI

A DS3231 RTC for accurate time + temperature

A NeoPixel LED strip for ambient animations

A buzzer + alarm logic (planned)

Optional PC configuration (future)

📐 Architecture & Code Structure
Main Components

ClockDisplay class

Draws the time (HH:MM:SS)

Handles day/date formatting

Displays temperature

Alternates date ↔ temperature every 15 seconds

Uses compact typography

Manages alignment (top-right text)

LEDAnimator class

Handles NeoPixel animations

Current mode: smooth cyan breathing

Flicker-free brightness peak handling

Future modes planned:

Alarm flash

Color transitions

Night dim mode

Main Loop (PlatformIO)

Reads RTC time

Colon blink every 500ms

Updates display every frame

Updates LEDs every ~30ms

🖥 Display Features Implemented
✔ Time View

Large HH:MM

Blinking colon

Small seconds on right

✔ Date / Temperature Alternation

Every 15 seconds:

Compact date: Fr12

Temperature:

Using DS3231 internal sensor

Displayed as 25˙C (top-dot fallback using ˙)

✔ Top-Right Auto Toggle Manager

We added logic (not shown here but part of main loop) that decides whether to draw:

drawDate(...)

drawTemperature(...)

🌡 Temperature Handling

Uses rtc.getTemperature()

DS3231 resolution: ±0.25°C

Auto-updates every 64 seconds internally

Rounded for clean UI

Rendered top-right in small font

Dot-above (˙) displayed as substitute degree

Ensured alignment does NOT break layout

💡 NeoPixel LED Features
✔ Cyan Breathing Animation

Fully refactored into LEDAnimator.cpp

No flicker at max brightness

Smooth easing-like behavior

Works on a pixel range defined by the user

✔ Helper: setPixelRangeColor(...)
🧱 Hardware

You are assisting with a PlatformIO project for an Arduino Nano called “Modular OLED Clock”.
The hardware includes:
- SSD1306 128x64 I2C OLED
- DS3231 RTC with onboard temperature sensor
- NeoPixel LED strip (5 LEDs)
- (planned) buzzer
- (planned) push button

Software structure:
- A `ClockDisplay` class draws the clock UI.
- It shows HH:MM with blinking colon, small seconds, and a top-right compact date.
- It also displays DS3231 temperature, switching every 15 seconds with the date.
- Temperature uses “˙C” as a pseudo-degree symbol.
- A `LEDAnimator` class controls a NeoPixel breathing animation.
- The breathing animation is cyan, smooth, and flicker-free at peak brightness.
- The main loop handles: RTC reading, colon blink, LED updates, alternating date/temperature display.

We are currently:
- Improving the display logic
- Adding LED modes (idle, alarm)
- Planning alarm + buzzer logic
- Expanding features incrementally
- Maintaining clean architecture
- Using git with a `dev` branch
- Keeping the README and commits updated

Continue assisting with development, code improvements, UI tweaks, LED effects, and future features.
Be consistent with earlier design decisions and coding patterns.
