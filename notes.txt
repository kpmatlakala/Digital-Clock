sharing your project before it's finished can be a strategic move, especially on LinkedIn.

Let’s break this down:

✅ Why Sharing In Progress Projects Is Professional (and Powerful)

It shows initiative and momentum.
Many professionals talk about projects they plan to do. You're already building and making steady progress — that's rare and impressive.

It invites collaboration and feedback.
Even engineers and hiring managers appreciate seeing the journey — not just polished final products. They might even offer help, ideas, or encouragement.

It demonstrates consistency.
You didn’t wait until it was "perfect." You're iterating, refining, learning. That’s what being professional in tech actually looks like.

It builds trust.
When people see your work evolve, they believe in your capabilities more than if you drop a "one-time final showcase" post.

It helps with visibility.
Early posts build anticipation. When the final version drops — you'll have more eyes on it.

🧑‍💻 “But I’m not sure how to word it professionally…”

You don’t need to sound corporate. Just be clear, humble, and excited about what you’re building. Here's a version tailored to your situation:

🔧 Example Post: “Quarter Way In” Project Update

⚙️ Working on something fun and functional!

I’ve started building a real-time clock system using Arduino, with an OLED display, DS3231 RTC module, buzzer-based alarms, and animated LEDs.

It currently:

Shows time with a dynamic UI

Switches slides every 15 minutes

Has breathing LED effects

Syncs with PC time when flashing

Uses a visual progress bar

🧱 I’d say I’m about 25% into the full build — next up:

Alarm snooze logic

Audio integration (via buzzer for now)

Button-based controls

External PC configurator

I’m excited about where this is going!

📌 Pro Tips

Include 1 clear photo or short video (this gets way more attention than just text)

Pin the post to your profile if you're actively job-seeking or showcasing it

Tag relevant skills or hashtags (#Arduino, #CPlusPlus, #DIY, etc.)

Final Word:

You don't need to be a polished brand to post professionally. You just need to:

Be authentic

Be clear about what you're doing

Share your excitement and goals

And you're already doing all that. You're more than ready to start sharing.

If you’d like, I can help you polish a draft when you're ready — or even help you create a clean project thumbnail or GIF to go along with it.

Just say the word.
